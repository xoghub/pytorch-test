    "You've seen that the journey of building a neural network begins with data. Before you can design a model or start the training process, you must gather your information and prepare it in a format the model can understand. In PyTorch, that fundamental format is the **tensor**. Tensors are more than just data containers; they are optimized for the mathematical operations that power deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering tensors is a vital step. Many of the most common errors encountered when building models are related to tensor shapes, types, or dimensions. This lab is designed to give you a solid foundation in tensor manipulation, providing you with the skills to handle data effectively and debug issues with confidence.\n",

    "* Create tensors from different data sources like Python lists and NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reshape and manipulate tensor dimensions to prepare data for model inputs.\n",

    "### Exercise 4: Feature Engineering for Taxi Fares\n",
    "\n",
    "You are working with a dataset of taxi trips. You have a tensor, `trip_data`, where each row is a trip and the columns represent **[distance (km), hour_of_day (24h)]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your goal** is to engineer a new binary feature called `is_rush_hour_long_trip`. This feature should be `True` (or `1`) only if a trip meets **both** of the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's a **long trip** (distance > 10 km).\n",
    "* It occurs during a **rush hour** (8-10 AM or 5-7 PM, i.e., `[8, 10)` or `[17, 19)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Slice** the `trip_data` tensor to isolate the `distance` and `hour` columns.\n",
    "2. Use **logical and comparison operators** to create boolean masks for each condition (long trip, morning rush, evening rush).\n",
    "3. Combine these masks to create the final `is_rush_hour_long_trip` feature.\n",
    "4. **Reshape** this new 1D feature tensor into a 2D column vector and convert its data type to float so it can be combined with the original data.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this lab! You have now worked through the fundamental building blocks of PyTorch. You started with an empty slate and learned to create, reshape, combine, and query tensors in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills you have developed here are essential for every machine learning practitioner. The element-wise arithmetic and broadcasting you practiced are precisely how a neural network efficiently applies weights and biases to entire batches of data at once. The reshaping techniques like `unsqueeze` and `squeeze` are what allow you to prepare a single data point for a model that expects a batch, and then clean up the output afterward. These are not just abstract exercises; they are the day-to-day operations required to build and debug effective deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this solid understanding of tensors, you are now fully prepared to move on to the next stage: building and training neural networks to solve even more complex problems. Every model you build from now on will stand on this foundation."
